# Hydration Error Fixes

This document summarizes the hydration issues that were identified and fixed in the Ample Education Frontend application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. localStorage Access During SSR
**Problem**: Components were accessing `localStorage` during server-side rendering, which doesn't exist on the server.

**Components Fixed**:
- `components/ModalNotification.tsx`
- `app/uk/appointment/page.tsx`
- `app/uk/appointment/success/AppointmentSuccess.jsx`

**Solution**: Added client-side checks using a `useClient` hook to ensure localStorage is only accessed after hydration.

### 2. Window Object Access During SSR
**Problem**: Components were accessing `window` object during server-side rendering.

**Components Fixed**:
- `components/BackToTopButton.tsx`
- `hooks/use-mobile.ts`

**Solution**: Added client-side checks and `typeof window !== 'undefined'` guards.

### 3. Date Formatting During SSR
**Problem**: Components were using `toLocaleDateString()` and `toLocaleTimeString()` during SSR, which can produce different results on server vs client.

**Components Fixed**:
- `components/Testimonials.tsx`
- `components/BlogCard.tsx`
- `app/(frontendpages)/events/page.tsx`
- `app/(frontendpages)/universities/single/[id]/page.tsx`

**Solution**: Added client-side checks to only format dates after hydration.

### 4. Incorrect suppressHydrationWarning Placement
**Problem**: `suppressHydrationWarning` was incorrectly placed in className instead of as a separate attribute.

**Components Fixed**:
- `app/(auth)/layout.tsx`

**Solution**: Moved `suppressHydrationWarning` to be a proper HTML attribute.

## New Utility Hook

Created `hooks/use-client.ts` to provide a consistent way to detect client-side rendering:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useClient() {
  const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsClient(true);
  }, []);

  return isClient;
}
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Client-side Detection**: Always check if running on client before accessing browser APIs
2. **Consistent Pattern**: Use the `useClient` hook for all client-side checks
3. **Fallback Values**: Provide fallback values for server-side rendering
4. **Proper Attribute Placement**: Ensure `suppressHydrationWarning` is placed correctly

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all environment variables used in client components are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Consider using dynamic imports for heavy client-only libraries
3. **Error Boundaries**: The existing ErrorBoundary component helps catch hydration errors
4. **Testing**: Test the application in both development and production modes

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. Run `npm run build && npm start` to test in production mode
2. Check browser console for hydration warnings
3. Test components that use localStorage, window, or date formatting
4. Verify that the application works correctly on both server and client
